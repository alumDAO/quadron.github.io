# About Us 


## Story

One of Americaâ€™s  greatest superpowers is our rich history of academic research and collaboration. University research is the engine of innovation in the world and we aim to get more research out of the lab and into the world. 

University research brought us the internet itself when a professor at UCLA sent the first transmission from one computer to another computer in Stanford in 1969. ARPANet further connected Universities working for DARPA and the internet was born.

AlumniDAO aims to carry on this tradition of research, development, and commercialization of bleeding edge technologies.  

## Principles

- The DAO will not be anonymous in order to conduct commercial affairs offline.
- The DAO will be truly decentralized and run based on majority consensus. 
- The Treasury of the DAO will be fully transparent to anyone holding at least 1 token.
- Communications will be fully transparent, except as needed to protect the interest of the DAO as determined by its members, and shall take place principally on Discord at: https://discord.gg/btuxGcheQC
- The DAO will be organized as a legal entity and intends to be recognized and operate as such to limit the liability of its members. The future members shall determine and settle upon the ideal legal structure to execute the DAOs mission.
- The DAO will conduct itself ethically, honestly, and lawfully and will not tolerate illegal or unethical practices. If this is not upheld, the DAOs members have a duty and obligation to shut it down.
