# How It Works

Now more than ever, the world needs more researchers doing more research. AlumDAO is focused on coming up with new and creative methods to ensure that happens.

## How we develop and license intellectual property 

We intend to form AlumDAO as a non-profit with the mission of developing academic research to the point it is ready to be commercialized. This non-profit entity is envisioned to have a wholly owned subsidiary (the “Holding Company”) that holds and/or licenses intellectual property created in the pursuit of its mission. It may sublicense or sell its ownership rights held by the Holding Company as it deems appropriate to see the intellectual property can be best utilized and reach the market at large.

Our primary channel for developing intellectual property would be to commission and co-develop technology through research with partner academic institutions. Initially, the academic institution’s office of tech transfer would hold the rights to the intellectual property. They would be responsible for patenting, maintaining, and defending the intellectual property until such a point that we decided to license it through the Holding Company. The process of obtaining patents is time consuming and expensive so our preference would be for this responsibility to remain with tech transfer until an inflection point is reached in the research where we believe commercial viability is possible.

To protect our initial investment, we would enter into a Right of First Refusal arrangement with the partner academic institution that would grant the Holding Company the right, but not the obligation to license any created intellectual property prior to it being marketed more broadly to any other interested parties.

By structuring our position as a Right of First Refusal rather than applying for the patent ourselves, we are able to leverage the existing strengths of academic tech transfer offices in obtaining and maintaining patents while also giving us flexibility and higher return on our research dollars deployed. 

### Beyond intellectual property

- Proof of degree (Verified, highly selective group of talented people in one network; high signal to noise ratio)
- Networking / hiring (“Uber for specialized knowledge workers” idea)
- Batches (similar to Y Combinator) of spinoffs where cofounders can collaborate and focus resources of the network on a few highly promising opportunities
- Other
